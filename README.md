# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bikeshare 

## Introduction
This is my approach to the **Capstone Project** from the **Google Data Analytics Specialization** course from Coursera. In this project, I will be analyzing data provided by Cyclistic, a fictional company, using the following steps learned from this specialization:
1.  **Ask**
2.  **Prepare**
3.  **Process**
4.  **Analyze**
5.  **Share**
6.  **Act**

## Background
I am  a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Ask
The Question Moreno assigned me to is: 
> "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
